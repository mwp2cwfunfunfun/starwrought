# STARWROUGHT: working agreement

Classless d20 TTRPG, pf2e-inspired, data-first, built for Foundry VTT.
Full system rules live in `starwrought-core-design.md`. Read it before designing anything.

## Scope

**Application code is in scope (Mike, 2026-08-27).** The old standing rule ("Claude does not update
application code") is retired, not suspended. Claude edits the spreadsheets, the templates, the
pipeline scripts, and the generators, and runs the pipeline. No permission round-trip per file.

What replaces it is not a shorter fence but an ordinary engineering obligation: **know which files
are sources and which are output, and leave the repo building.**

### Sources, and what they generate

| Edit this | Never hand-edit this |
|---|---|
| `data/*.xlsx` | `assets/trees.json`, `backgrounds.json`, `languages.json` |
| `assets/roster.json` (hand-kept blocks) and `sheet_spec.json` | the `ancestries` block of `roster.json` (the converter overwrites it from `ancestries.xlsx`) |
| `assets/app_template.html`, `constellation_template.html` | `Starwrought_App.html`, `Starwrought_Talent_Constellations.html` |
| `assets/*.py`, `assets/build_phb.js` | `assets/constellations/*.png`, the PDFs, the compendium |
| `foundry/starwrought/` **except** `packs/`, `content/`, `assets/constellations/` | those three, which `assets/build_foundry.mjs` regenerates |
| `data/SYNC.json` (via `build_all.mjs --accept-phb`) | `foundry/starwrought/content/sync.json` |

**The web app and the Foundry system are siblings, not a chain.** Both read `assets/trees.json` and
`assets/roster.json`; neither reads the other. Asked whether the app should read the Foundry
compendia instead (Mike, 2026-08-27): no. It would make one consumer depend on another consumer's
output, swap two JSON files for 364, and give the app a shape built for Foundry rather than the
tree structure it actually wants. The thing that keeps them in step is `build_all.mjs` and the
handbook rule, not a shared data path.

Hand-editing a generated file is not forbidden, it is simply pointless: the next pipeline run
destroys it. Fix the source.

### The pipeline

One command runs all of it and then checks for handbook drift:

```
node assets/build_all.mjs              # every step below, in order, then the drift check
node assets/build_all.mjs --check      # only the drift check
node assets/build_all.mjs --skip-slow  # skip the plates, the sheets, and the compendium docx
node assets/build_all.mjs --accept-phb # record the current handbook as synced, once the work is done
```

**THE HANDBOOK RULE (Mike, 2026-08-27, standing).** When the PHB moves, everything downstream moves
with it: `data/*.xlsx`, the web app, the Foundry system, the system's `FEATURES.md`, and its
`CHANGELOG.md`, which gets an entry every time even if only to say what moved. `data/SYNC.json`
records the version the repository is synced to; `build_all.mjs` exits 1 while the handbook on the
shelf is newer, and refuses to stamp a new version until the changelog and the features file both
name it. The Foundry system carries the stamp into the game as `game.starwrought.rules.phb`.

The individual steps, from the project root, in this order. They need `openpyxl`, `matplotlib`,
`reportlab`, `python-docx`, and the `docx` npm package; all are installed.

```
python assets/xlsx_to_trees.py        # data/*.xlsx -> trees/backgrounds/languages JSON. Refuses to write on errors.
python assets/inject.py               # templates + JSON -> the two root HTML files
python assets/render_constellations.py # -> assets/constellations/*.png
python assets/sheet_gen.py            # -> the fillable and Mira character sheets
node   assets/build_phb.js            # -> Starwrought_Constellation_Compendium.docx
node   assets/build_foundry.mjs       # -> foundry/starwrought/{packs,content,assets/constellations}
python assets/check_style.py          # the two absolute rules below, enforced. Exit 1 on a violation.
```

`build_foundry.mjs` sits next to `build_phb.js` for the same reason: both read `trees.json` and
`roster.json`, so both must re-run whenever those change. It writes `packs/_source/*.json` and then
compiles the LevelDB compendia with `@foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli` (a devDependency); `--no-compile`
stops after the sources. Document ids hash the pack plus the document name, so they survive a
rebuild, which matters because an id becomes a compendium UUID the moment a Talent lands on a
character sheet. `check_style.py` scans the system's `lang/en.json`, its templates, and
`packs/_source/`, so the Foundry content is held to the same two rules as everything else.

**The compiled packs are not in git.** `foundry/install.mjs` links the repo folder into Foundry's
data directory, so a running Foundry rewrites the LevelDB log and manifest files under `packs/<pack>/`
every time a world opens; committed, they dirtied the tree on every session. `packs/_source/*.json`
is committed and is the source of truth; `build_foundry.mjs` compiles it locally, and
`.github/workflows/release.yml` compiles it again on a fresh checkout before packaging.

### What is expected of a change, not asked permission for

- **Back up before a destructive pass.** `backup/pre-<version>/` is the convention; two exist.
- **Leave it building.** `xlsx_to_trees.py` must report zero validation errors,
  `node assets/smoke_test.js <extracted app script>` must come back SMOKE CLEAN (extract the script
  with the one-liner in `data/README.txt`), and `python assets/check_style.py` must exit 0.
- **Look at it.** The app is HTML: serve it and drive it. Several real bugs in the v1.8 and v3.0
  syncs (mojibake on every plate, a migration that silently dropped a character's Calling, rows
  overflowing the sheet) were invisible to the test suites and obvious in a browser. The Foundry
  system is the same rule: `node foundry/install.mjs`, launch a world on it, and drive a character.
  Its first build had four bugs no unit test would have caught (a module namespace written to at
  init, `getRollData` mutating the live system object, Flares that would not turn off, and raw
  i18n keys on the adversary sheet), and every one of them was obvious on screen in a minute.
- **Say what you changed and what you left.** Version syncs get a `v<version>-sync-report.md` in the
  project root, listing the rulings made on ambiguous PHB text. Those reports are how the handbook
  gets corrected: v3.1 adopted most of the v3.0 report's rulings verbatim.

Still worth a question rather than a guess: **a rules ambiguity with two defensible readings**
(they go in the sync report), and **deleting authored game content**, which is Mike's call every time.

## Standing design rules

**The Root Rule (v0.38).** Every constellation root and every bloodline root must carry (1)
something that gets *rolled*, so the constellation can Flare from the one talent every member owns,
and (2) something that *improves at Expert/Master/Legendary*. The `X Training` roots are the model:
"add the constellation's proficiency to its checks" satisfies both in one clause. Scaling shape is
chosen for flavor, not uniformity (Rage graduates damage, halfling luck graduates uses per session,
Stonewise graduates reach). Keep ancestry and bloodline bonuses narrow and circumstantial, because
every character gets both roots free.

**VTT assumption (Mike's ruling, v0.40, standing).** STARWROUGHT assumes a virtual tabletop. Not
"supports one," assumes one. The grid is 1 foot, diagonals are measured exactly, and every weapon has
a reach in feet. There is no battlemat fallback and no theatre-of-the-mind mode, and Claude should
stop offering them.

What this licenses, and Claude should design accordingly: **arithmetic and tracked state are now
cheap, and decisions are the only real cost.** Per-zone Protection, the material-weakness step, the
damage order of operations, Exposed zones, Wounded, Dying, Persistent Damage, MAP, Load Strain,
attribute derivation and rank thresholds are all things software does for free. Do not simplify a
rule to spare a player arithmetic. Do simplify a rule that asks a player to hold more than one
decision in their head at once.

The standing risk to flag, not to solve: **a rule that needs GM judgement inside a formula cannot be
automated.** "Expose a plausible zone" is the current example. Prefer rules a machine can resolve, and
put the judgement at the edges rather than the middle.

**Style rule (standing, absolute).** No em-dashes in game prose, anywhere, ever. Use periods,
semicolons, colons, commas, or parentheses. Table null-markers and minus signs are fine.

**IP hygiene.** Mechanics may echo pf2e (ORC-licensed); names and prose must be original. No
Golarion proper nouns in anything shipping.

Both of the above are enforced by **`python assets/check_style.py`**, which exits 1 on a violation.
It reads the spreadsheets, the injected JSON, the templates, and the built HTML. Naming the games
themselves (pf2e, D&D) is a note, not a failure: the rule above permits echoing them, and an ORC
notice has to name pf2e. The handbook is scanned as advisory only, since it is Mike's to write.
A line marked `style-ok` is skipped; the only honest use is the migration rename maps, which have to
name the retired terms in order to rename them away.

**Flare triggers** are one universal rule (v0.11): a constellation Flares on a critical success or
critical failure on any roll with consequences, directly related to a talent in that constellation.
Per-tree trigger lists are flavor illustrations, never rules, and should all read as the universal
wording.

**Rank math.** Trained 1 pt, Expert 4, Master 9, Legendary 16, gated at L1/L5/L13/L19. Every talent
costs 1. Capstones (★) are tier L and need a Master talent in the same constellation. Attribute
bonus = points ÷ 3, rounded down, max +5. **There is no min +1**: the PHB's own table has read
0–2 points = +0 since v1.8, and the app implements the table. A single point in a constellation buys
proficiency, not an attribute bonus.

## Where the source of truth lives

- **The highest-numbered `Starwrought_Players_Handbook_v*.docx` is authoritative for the rules.**
  It is hand-authored in Word. `assets/phb_edit.py` exists for the one case where Claude is asked to
  change it: it appends a sentence to a named paragraph, matching that paragraph's own run
  formatting, and copies every other byte of the package through untouched. It writes a NEW
  numbered file rather than editing one in place, so the version Mike authored stays the version
  Mike authored. Verify with a diff of the two documents: entry count, paragraph count, and the
  exact list of changed lines. Check for a newer one before starting a sync; v3.1 landed while the
  v3.0 sync was still being written. `data/*.xlsx` derives from it and is authoritative for the app;
  when the two disagree, the handbook wins and the sheets need a pass.
- **`assets/build_phb.js` deliberately does not regenerate the handbook.** That would put rules prose
  in two places and guarantee drift. It builds `Starwrought_Constellation_Compendium.docx`: the
  creation menus, all 30 constellations, and the reference appendices, every table read from
  `trees.json` and `roster.json`. That is content that must track the data exactly.
- `data/*.xlsx` holds all game content. One `_Tree Index` sheet per workbook.
- Ancestry rows in `data/ancestries.xlsx` `_Tree Index` also carry HP, Size, Speed, Senses, Summary.
  The pipeline reads those and generates the `ancestries` block of `roster.json`, so ancestry chassis
  is authored once, in the sheet.
- `* Lore` sheets in `ancestries.xlsx` are authoring notes for player-facing text. The converter
  ignores them by design.
- Tree sheet columns: Talent, Tier, Root, Requires, Prerequisites, Description, Effect, Feeds,
  Grants, **Choice**, **Free Talent**. Column order does not matter; the first word of the header
  does. `Root` = `x` for a constellation root, `h` for a bloodline root.
- **`Choice`** is a build-time pick the talent's effect demands, written as what is being chosen
  ("Weapon Group", "Weapon Group or Technical Weapon"). **`Free Talent`** names a talent handed
  over outright with no point spent, and may live in another constellation; the converter checks it
  exists. Both were added 2026-08-27 because Drilled's "you gain Weapon Familiarity for free,
  choose one Weapon Group" was prose only, so no implementation could act on it and Weapon
  Familiarity had no mechanical effect anywhere. If an effect asks the player to pick something
  **once, at build time**, it needs a Choice cell. Per-use picks (a Zone, a target, a Defense) do
  not; only two talents in the book qualify.
- The pipeline warns on any root that breaks the Root Rule, so violations surface on the next sync.

## Known outstanding work

- Open rules question: halfling luck converts a critical failure into a failure, which removes the
  crit that would have Flared the Origin. Undecided whether a Flare triggers on the die or on the
  final result. (Halflings are not in the current data, so this is dormant until they return.)
- Two roots break the Root Rule on purpose, both Human bloodlines: **Versatile Human** ("You gain 1
  Opening Talent Point") and **Torchbearer Human** (allies' first Defense roll). Neither rolls, and
  neither scales. The pipeline warns on both every sync. Either they get a scaling clause or the
  Root Rule gets an exemption for bloodlines.
- The PHB prints one non-Trained talent in the whole book (*Reactive Strike*, tier E). The Expert,
  Master, and Legendary tiers are otherwise unwritten across all 30 constellations.
- **Armored Fighting's Key Attribute is contradictory and still open in v3.1.** Its section heading
  says *Combat Style • Presence*; the Combat Styles summary table says **Might**. The data uses
  Presence, following the heading, as Shield Fighting was resolved. One cell in `combat_styles.xlsx`
  either way. **This is the tree-level `Feeds` only.** Armored Fighting's per-talent `Feeds`
  overrides are deliberate and mixed (Mike, 2026-08-27): six Might including the root, three
  Presence, two Wits, two Agility. Resolving the heading-vs-table question must not flatten them.

Cleared 2026-08-27: the de-Paizo pass (cultures are now Serrovane and Kestrel Reach); the stale
`build_phb.js`, now a data-driven compendium builder; the missing and orphaned constellation plates;
the `Save`/`Heritage` category names; the converter's cp1252 crash and the matching mojibake in the
plate renderer; the character sheet's three-Defense layout. The 8-vs-10 Combat Styles table and the
three `TBD$$$$$` background descriptions were fixed by v3.1.
